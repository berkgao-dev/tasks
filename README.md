# tasks
 java backend test for ADASOFT

## Requirements(Given tasks):
//Create a Console API with the following tasks (I also included a controller): get, post, put, delete, entity task {id, name} with h2 database.
//GET /tasks -> get all tasks
//GET /completedTasks -> get all completed tasks
//GET /pendingTasks -> get all pending tasks
//POST /tasks -> create a task in pending state
//PUT /tasks/{id}/complete -> mark task as completed
//PUT /tasks/{id}/pending -> mark task as pending
//PUT /tasks/{id} -> update task by id
//DELETE /tasks/{id} -> delete task by id
//Use flyway to create the database schema.
//Use lombok to generate the getters, setters, equals and hashcode.
//Use spring boot to create the rest api. (It was not necessary for the test, but I used it as a personal challenge)
//Use jpaRepository to access the database.
//Use h2 as database.
//Use junit to test the api.
//Use mockito to mock the dependencies.
